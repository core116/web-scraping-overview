## Overview

In today's digital world, vast amounts of information are freely available on public web pages. Extracting this data can often be tricky due to the structureless nature of the web. This led me to the intriguing world of Web Scraping.

Web Scraping is an automated method used to extract vast amounts of data from websites. The data on the websites is unstructured. Web Scraping helps to gather this data and store it in a structured form. I found this field to be an exciting application of my skills in Python, eliciting information where it seemed impossible.

Feel free to explore each project throughout this repository and reach out if you have any questions! Happy scraping!
